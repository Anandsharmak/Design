Thank you for the time.
As i was not familiar with the spring boot in java 
I tried making a command line program for this.
Though this is not what might have been expected as Rest Apis were mentioned.
But while practicing on my own for low level design i never encountered a program which required 
rest apis.
I tried my best to come up with a solution that extensible as well as follows solid design principle.

//Update:

Adding Spring boot:

Create Spring Boot Dependency using:

https://start.spring.io
